# Image-based Profiling for cpg0014-jump-adipocyte

This repository was derived from a [template repository](https://github.blog/2019-06-06-generate-new-repositories-with-repository-templates/) located at https://github.com/cytomining/profiling-template.
The purpose of the repository is to weld together a versioned data processing pipeline with versioned processed output data for a single image-based profiling experiment.

Note:
- There are different numbers of channels between plates/batches. In Batch1/2/5, the U2OS cells have 3 Brightfield channels while in Batch3/4 they only have 1 Brightfield channel. The hWAT plates have 1 Brightfield channel in all batches.

- There was a staining artifact in Batch2, plates BR00135829-BR00135846 where two rows (rows 05 and 06) of images are bad.
